point 1]

## Who is the audience for the presentation?

Attendants of AXA DevCon on June 4, 2024. An internal developer
conference at AXA Switzerland, not open to the public
AFAIK. Developers which may or may not have frontend experience, may
have never heard about web components, or if, perhaps with negative
connotation. From junior level, even apprentices to very senior level.

Who else is likely to see the presentation?

Perhaps Katrin, the CIO? (I should invite her!) If video is allowed,
future talk committee members at international conferences who have
to decide whether I should give a talk at *their* conference!

Why do they care about the subject?

They care unwittingly because they will have typical enterprise
problems to solve and may not know the escape hatch, which is 'there's
a web component for that'. They care when told that web is the most
successful software delivery platform of the world.

What do I want them to know about the topic? (3-5 things)

1. There's a magic trick to escape any impossible enterprisey
situation when you are on the web: write another web component!
2. Here's five typical situation where this works....
3. Web components have been badmouthed, but enterprises quietly adopt
them more and more - and you can, too!
4. Case study: <sig-nal> enables server-side rendering for the enterprise
5. Being entangled in enterprise is fun, once you accept the challenge
and free yourself like Houdini, which means in 2024: there's a web
component for that!

What I hope to accomplish by presenting? (1-3 things)
(This is what you want, not what the audience wants. e.g. for a
project to be funded, to hire more people, to give management
confidence in the teamâ€™s capabilities.)

1. Clear the bad image of web components
2. Show my technical expertise in an easy-to-understand way
3. Gain trust for teaching as AXA's ambassador at Swiss institutions
of higher learning and as a conference speaker at international
frontend conferences
