## Who was Houdini?

Harry Houdini was a professional American magician and escape artist who was famous at the start of the 20th century for his stunts in which he invariably escaped impossible-looking situations. In the [Washington DC prison escape](https://parkviewdc.com/2010/10/01/houdinis-escape-from-the-10th-precinct/) of January 1, 1906 it took him all of 18 minutes to defeat his handcuffs, open 5 locks of his cell, and get his clothes from the neighbouring cell. "Stone walls and chains do not make a prison - for Houdini" reads the caption of his photo.

## What is Enterprise?

Enterprise IT serves the needs of a large business organization &mdash; an enterprise &mdash; not just an individual user. Things have grown over the years, one has to protect against hostile actors from outside, auditing requirements need to be met, users have access rights and restrictions. 

For a frontend software engineer working in Enterprise, terms like stonewalls, chains, prison feel familiar - your hands are often tied, you can't move fast and break things, things are locked down, yet the show must go on and your web site must be up and running 24/7. Where's Houdini in that situation?
