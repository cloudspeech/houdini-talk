## I am Markus, but Who was Houdini?

Harry Houdini was a professional American magician and escape
artist.

He was famous at the start of the last century for his stunts in which
he invariably escaped impossible-looking situations.

In the [Washington DC prison
escape](https://parkviewdc.com/2010/10/01/houdinis-escape-from-the-10th-precinct/)
of 19-oh-6 it took him all of 18 minutes to defeat his
handcuffs, open 5 locks of his cell, and get his clothes from the
neighbouring cell.

> "Stone walls and chains do not make a prison - for Houdini"

reads the caption of his photo.

## And What is Enterprise?

Enterprise IT serves the needs of a large business organization &mdash; an enterprise &mdash; not just an individual user.

Things have grown over the years, one has to protect against hostile
actors from outside, auditing requirements need to be met, users have
access rights and restrictions.  

For a frontend software engineer working in Enterprise, terms like
stonewalls, chains, prison feel familiar - your hands are often tied,
you can't move fast and break things, things are locked down, yet the
show must go on and your web site must be up and running 24/7.

Where's Houdini in that situation?

### What is Enterprise Frontend like?

As everybody knows, frontend deals with HTML - the structure, 'what is what' -, CSS - the
styling, 'how it looks', and JavaScript - the interactivity, 'how it responds'.

Now typical enterprise restrictions are:

- traditional, web pages dominate, lots and lots of HTML. __Not__ SPAs, __not__ PWAs.
- you don't own the whole page
- you can't run JavaScript on the server
- SEO is crucial

So, out goes:

- most frontend frameworks, and
- whole-page performance optimization

Houdini, please help!

## Here comes The Magic Trick

Whenever you're stuck in yet another impossible Enterprise situation,
do this:

> write a web component!

That's it, that's the escape, that's Houdini's magic trick for the enterprise,
you can do it basically every single time.

&lt;web-component&gt;s are HTML tags with a dash in the name that you
define yourself with a little JavaScript. All major browsers support
them.

And since the foundation is always HTML, we can always use that trick.

How?

I'll show you now.

## Here's five typical situations where the trick works

### 1. Situation: UI components

Most people know this one already.

A design system is good for enterprise
brand identity and includes UI components like buttons, form input
elements, date pickers and so on.

AXA's design system is open source and built with web
components since 2019.

It's called the
[AXA Pattern Library](https://axa-ch-webhub-cloud.github.io/plib-feature/develop/?path=/story/welcome--to-pattern-library).

Those web components are live on every page of [axa.ch](https://axa.ch).

Houdini's trick simply works. These days many enterprises do the same.

Therefore, let's move on to the next situation.

### 2. Situation: Slow Page Performance

So your boss tells you to make things load faster, because the Google
rating dropped...

"Oh", he says, "and can you please make it happen by tomorrow?"

But you don't own
the pages, hundreds of kilobytes of JavaScript and CSS assets must
stay.

Those assets are loaded via `<script>` and `<link>` tags, as usual,
which _also_ have to stay in place.

Should you give up, or can you escape the impossible situation? 

Of course, you can escape!

Just use Houdini's trick!

Step 1: wish yourself a new HTML tag called script-with-a-dash
(`<scri-pt>`) with new
behaviour.

Here we want at least two things.

One is to delay loading an asset until the
browser is idle. Idle means the browser is not busy doing more
important things like painting pixels.

The other behaviour is to delay loading until you scroll down _so much_ so that the
new tag becomes visible.

Step 2: invent your own attributes to control that
new behaviour.

Because "script when visible, or script when idle" sounds good, we decide
to invent the `when` attribute:

```html
<scri-pt when="visible">...</scri-pt>
<scri-pt when="idle">...</scri-pt>
```

Step 3: compose your markup as a mix of old tags and the new one.

Because nothing loads automatically inside a `<template>` tag, we can
wrap the things to load with a template and then put
script-with-a-dash around it:

```html
<scri-pt when="visible">
  <template>
    <script src="big-fat-bundle.js"></script>
  </template>
</scri-pt>
```

That snippet means:

load that big fat bundle _only_ when the user
scrolled down _so much_ that script-with-a-dash is visible.

Step 4: now do-it-yourself, _define_ the new behaviour.

Keep it simple.

No framework, just plain old JavaScript:

```js
class ScriPt extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    if (this.getAttribute("when") === "visible") {
      const observer = new IntersectionObserver( entries => entries[0].isIntersecting && this.#load() && observer.disconnect() );
      return observer.observe(this);
    }
    requestIdleCallback(this.#load);
  }

  #load = () => this.appendChild(this.firstElementChild.content.cloneNode(true));
}

customElements.define("scri-pt", ScriPt);
```

Aaand... in just 11 lines of code, Houdini's escape is perfect:
script-with-a-dash does the trick!

To see a production version of this _live_ &mdash; under the alias
axa-script,&mdash; just visit _any_ [axa.ch](https://axa.ch) page.

### 3. Situation: Microfrontends

Microfrontends boil down to one simple idea:

> embed apps in HTML.

Such apps are written in JavaScript and placed _somewhere_ on
a web page.

They could be good for anything, like calculating a
mortgage or show your insurances or whatever.

If you do it right, teams can then deploy and maintain such
apps _independent_ of your site releases, which is a huge win.

But not all apps are alike.

For example, some might first require login for user authentication.

Only _after_ login can the app start and render itself.

Others require _waiting_ till all markup is parsed by
the browser, also known as 'DOM loaded'.

How can you embed _all_ such types of microfrontend apps in HTML?

You guessed it: easy-peasy if you use Houdini's trick!

First, do step 1 again: wish yourself micro-dash-frontend
(`<micro-frontend>`).

That is to say, a web component which knows how to embed _and_ start any type of app.

Step 2, add attributes.

Use `type` to indicate which kind of microfrontend it is:

for example use `type="auth"` for authentication-first, or `type="dom-loaded"` and so on.

Step 3, compose:

```html
<micro-frontend type="dom-loaded">
  <scri-pt when="visible" for="parentNode">
    <template>
      <script type="module" src="big-app-bundle.js"></script>
    </template>
  </scri-pt>
</micro-frontend>
```

That snippet means: place a microfrontend of type dom-loaded here.

The app will start and render under micro-dash-frontend once we are visible and
the big app bundle has loaded.

Did you notice something?

Yes, that's right: we did not have to define app-loading!

We simply reused script-with-a-dash...

_That's_ the power of composition at work!

Finally Step 4: do-it-yourself, define micro-dash-frontend in pure JavaScript.

I will spare you the details, but it's only 3-point-4 kiloBytes
compressed.

This is because Houdini's trick needs little code, if you think carefully about
composition _first_.

Each web component should only do _one_ thing, and do it well.

Finally, I invite you to see micro-dash-frontend for yourself!

It's _live_ on [axa.ch](https://axa.ch) pages, under the alias webhub-pod.

### Situation 4. Internationalization

Imagine customer research has found that some users _hate_ you.

They click on that link in their email, and don't understand the
German page that opens.

Then they use the language selector to switch to English or whatever.

And _then_ they _really_ hate you because they need to wait while the
page loads _again_.

Your boss yells: "no reload, but don't you dare and change anything else".

"And no performance regression, please."

Impossible situation again, or not?

How about... a little inspiration from Mister Houdini?

Step 1: wish yourself trans-dash-late (`<trans-late>`).

A web component which knows how to translate text when the page language changes.

Skip step 2: no attributes are needed!

Why? Because we can just observe updates of the `lang` attribute:

```html
<html lang="en">
```

And changing _that_ requires 1 line of JavaScript in the language selector.

Moving on to Step 3: compose:

```html
<trans-late>Houdini's Magic Trick for the Enterprise
    <template lang="de">Houdini's Magischer Trick f√ºr Enterprise Frontend</template>
</trans-late>
```

Anything under template is not rendered by the browser, so we're fine
visually.

The HTML is so clear, it speaks for itself.

Finally, Step 4: do-it-yourself, define trans-dash-late in JavaScript.

```js
const textNodes = new Map();

const getPageLanguage = () => document.documentElement.getAttribute("lang");

let pageLanguage = getPageLanguage();

const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
  const language = getPageLanguage();
  for (let [textNode, translations] of textNodes) {
    textNode.textContent = translations[language];
  }
});

observer.observe(document.documentElement, {
  attributes: true,
  attributeFilter: ["lang"],
});

class TransLate extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    const text = this.textContent.trim();
    const textNode = new Text(text);
    const translations = { [pageLanguage]: text };
    this.querySelectorAll("template").forEach(template => {
      const language = template.getAttribute("lang");
      const text = template.content.textContent.trim();
      translations[language] = text;
    });
    textNodes.set(textNode, translations);
    this.replaceWith(textNode);
  }
}

customElements.define("trans-late", TransLate);

```
Yes, that's all! 28 lines of easy-to-understand JavaScript for
Houdini's trick are enough here.

But did you notice something?

Ladies and Gentlemen, a new stunt by Houdini: the self-vanishing web component!

I say that because here trans-dash-late _replaces_ itself _with_ the text.

_How_ can that work?

Well, Houdini's tricks were all secret, but this is open source, so here's how:

Text is _also_ a DOM node, so we can store a global reference to it before we
remove the web component.

Then, when the page language changes, we just update all the stored nodes,
and bingo &mdash; no page reloads!

The take-home message is this:

You are in _full_ control of your web component's behaviour, how cool is _that_?!!

### 5. Situation: Server-Side Rendering for the Enterprise

So you discover it's impossible to do Server-Side Rendering in your
organization.

You know, that frontend hype thingie where you run JavaScript
server-side to pump out web pages.

You can't do that because you are rendering server-side already!

Your super-expensive Enterprise CMS written in Java is the one that
pumps out web pages!

And they are composed out of server-side components, available since
forever.

So you whine because you work in the enterprise and your boring CV
doesn't mention the latest frontend hypes.

You dream:

>If I could only sprinkle a little magic interactivity here and there
>in the components' HTML, I could escape the impossible situation...
>
> And there's this other hot frontend hype, signals: fine-grained
> reactive updates for values that change over time.
> Can I please have that too?

Dream no more, Houdini to the rescue!

Step 1: Wish yourself sig-dash-nal (<`sig-nal>`).

A web component which knows how to react and apply updates to a
certain place in your HTML.

Step 2: add attributes.

Use `ref` to reference a place by name:

```html
<signal ref="inc">+</sig-nal>
```

By default, that place is the parent node of `<sig-nal>`.

Use `new` to do the same but also create a named signal:

```html
<signal new="counter">Initial value of counter</sig-nal>
```

Use `type` to convert the initial signal value:

```html
<signal new="counter" type="number">3</sig-nal>
```

Use `hydrate` to express your interactivity:

```html
<sig-nal hydrate>
      { /* JavaScript object */
      }
</sig-nal>
```

That JavaScript object will pair names of DOM nodes
with reactions.

You might react to user input, for example clicks, or
when a signal value is updated.

We see an example right now, in

Step 3: compose

```html
    <template shadowrootmode="open">
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="./counterdemo.css"/>
      <h3>Interactive island</h3>
      <p>The server supplied the initial value <b>3.</b></p>
      <div>
        <button @click="counter"><sig-nal ref="dec">-</sig-nal></button>
        <div .textContent="counter"><sig-nal new="counter" type="number">3</sig-nal></div>
        <button @click="counter"><sig-nal ref="inc">+</sig-nal></button>
        <sig-nal hydrate>
          {
          counter: { ".textContent": rerender },
          inc: { "@click": ({ signal }) => signal.value++ },
          dec: { "@click": ({ signal }) => signal.value-- }
          }
        </sig-nal>
      </div>
    </template>
```

That reads as follows:

when the counter value updates, update the text
content of that `<div>`. Initially it's 3.

When you click on the plus-labelled button,
increment the signal named counter. 3 becomes 4, you click again, it
becomes 5, you get the idea.

Likewise, when hitting
that minus-labelled button, you decrement the counter signal. 3 becomes 2, and so on.

It's this short, but it will work without any compiler &mdash; I promise!

Step 4: do-it-yourself, define sig-nal in JavaScript. Under 1 KB
compressed, that's all you need. I open-sourced it [here](https://github.com/cloudspeech/sig-nal).

This is the last example, this is Houdini's trick at its best.

It's pure no-build goodness.

And it gives you that awesome [Lighthouse-100
performance rating](https://cloudspeech.github.io/sig-nal/counter.html).

Let me demo it real quick.

## Haters gonna hate, but Enterprise knows better

I am not living under a rock.

_Of course_ I know about blog posts like that famous one from the creator of Svelte,
[Rich Harris: Why I don't use web
components](https://dev.to/richharris/why-i-don-t-use-web-components-2cia).

But it seems Enterprise has overwhelmingly voted with their feet, as
[arewebcomponentsathingyet.com](https://arewebcomponentsathingyet.com/)
shows:

<img width="479" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-31 at 13 37 48" src="https://github.com/cloudspeech/houdini-talk/assets/850521/f9fc74a7-2c7c-4817-85c8-179cb9782575">

So haters gonna hate, but they can't touch Houdini.

## Happy escaping!

Let me summarize real quick.

I work in Enterprise frontend, that's where the jobs are.

And I discovered Houdini's magic trick:

There's an ~~app~~ web component for that!

I am happy again because I can help myself in every impossible
situation.

Yes, I might not be able to change much around me, but I can _always_ can bend HTML to
my will.

That's what web components do for me, that's why I recommend them to _you_:

they give you a principled way to escape.

So, happy escaping to all of you, and thanks for listening!
