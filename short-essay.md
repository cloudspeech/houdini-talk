## Who was Houdini?

Harry Houdini was a professional American magician and escape artist famous for his stunts in which he invariably escaped impossible-looking situations. In the [Washington DC prison escape](https://parkviewdc.com/2010/10/01/houdinis-escape-from-the-10th-precinct/) of January 1, 1906 it took him 18 minutes to defeat his handcuffs, 5 locks of his cell, and get his clothes from the neighbouring cell. "Stone walls and chains do not make a prison - for Houdini" reads the caption of his photo.
